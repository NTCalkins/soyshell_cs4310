Test cases for "mkdir":

[ P ] 1. Successfully creating a new directory.
[ P ] 2. Creating a directory within another directory.
[ F ] 3. Failing to create a new directory due to another directory having the same name and prompt user. (Fails, because it still returns 0)
[ F ] 4. Inputting too many arguments. (Fails in the script. Its kind of weird when I manually tested it) (Also, "too many arguments" could be changed to "more than 1 argument" to create multiple directories)
[ P ] 5. Successfully creating a new directory with one or more spaces in the directory's name.
[ P ] 6. Inputting too few arguments.
7. Using ".." within an argument.
